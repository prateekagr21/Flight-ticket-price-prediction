# Predicting the seat price of flight using Machine Learning Algorithms.

## For Solving this Usecase, What I have done is :

- Collected the data and organized to form a meaningful dataset.
- Checked for null values and observed the data to form meaningful insights.
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries.
- Finded correlation to form a Heatmap.

### Did data Preprocessing.
### Did Feature Selection.

## And then I made a Model for the Prediction :
- Independent and Dependent Features.
- Did Train-Test split


## Fitted the Model by using :
- RandomForestRegressor.
- Improved the accuracy by using Hyperparameter Tuning.
  - Randomized searchCV
- Plotted the Prediction.
- Finded the best parameters.
- Saved the model to pickle.
